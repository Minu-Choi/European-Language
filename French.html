          (français [fʁɑ̃sɛ] or langue française [lɑ̃ɡ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) is a Romance
          language of the Indo-European family. It descended from the Vulgar
          Latin of the Roman Empire, as did all Romance languages. French
          evolved from Gallo-Romance, the Latin spoken in Gaul, and more
          specifically in Northern Gaul. Its closest relatives are the other
          langues d'oïl—languages historically spoken in northern France and in
          southern Belgium, which French (Francien) largely supplanted. French
          was also influenced by native Celtic languages of Northern Roman Gaul
          like Gallia Belgica and by the (Germanic) Frankish language of the
          post-Roman Frankish invaders. Today, owing to France's past overseas
          expansion, there are numerous French-based creole languages, most
          notably Haitian Creole. A French-speaking person or nation may be
          referred to as Francophone in both English and French.
