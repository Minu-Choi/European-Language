          (espa√±ol or castellano, Castilian) is a Romance language of the
          Indo-European language family that evolved from colloquial Latin
          spoken in the Iberian Peninsula of Europe. Today, it is a global
          language with more than 500 million native speakers, mainly in the
          Americas and Spain. Spanish is the official language of 20 countries.
          It is the world's second-most spoken native language after Mandarin
          Chinese; the world's fourth-most spoken language overall after
          English, Mandarin Chinese, and Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu); and the
          world's most widely spoken Romance language. The largest population of
          native speakers is in Mexico.
